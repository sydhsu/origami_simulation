% Returns the lengths of the edges of graph described by nodes and edges

% INPUTS
% nodes: a d x n array of vertex coordinates where d is the dimension and n
% is the number of vertices
% edges: a m x 2 array listing the indices of the vertices connected by
% each edge

% OUTPUTS
% lengths: a 1 x m array of the lengths of the edges
